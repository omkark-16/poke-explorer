# Pokémon Explorer – React Application

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Pokémon Explorer** is a responsive frontend application built using **React** that allows users to search and explore detailed information about Pokémon. The application fetches data from an **external public API hosted on another server** and displays Pokémon details such as images, types, and abilities in a clean and intuitive user interface.

This project mainly focuses on understanding **API integration in React**, data fetching, state management, and implementing **search and sorting functionality** for better user experience.
